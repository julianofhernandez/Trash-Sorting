Computer vision using artificial neural networks has propagated throughout our culture and has begun having an array of technical implementations that make our lives easier. However, in order to make use of this technology within the field of trash management, a database of images will be needed to accurately train it. It's estimated that we will need over 1,000 images per class [1], and with over 100 individual classes outlined in the Sacramento Waste Wizard, the total number of images needed quickly rises into the 100,000s. Unfortunetly, almost all researchers in this space have elected to create their own datasets instead of building off of someone elses. This has caused a great amount of fragementation, a review of current trash image datsets has shwon that over 200,000 publically available images have beene collected. But because they aren't considated, using them is extremely difficult and has held back the future prospects of using neural networks for trash recognition.
