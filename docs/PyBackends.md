We will need a light yet fast and capable backend to handle information between our model and frontend interface. 
We can also create custom APIs to handle our model dataset and training, as well as frontend interface.

Below are some of the technologies and frameworks that may be useful in developing a python based backend:

API Formats:

REST API: [https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api#rest](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api#rest)

REST API Setup and more information: [https://restfulapi.net](https://restfulapi.net/)

Python based Web frameworks:

Flask: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
