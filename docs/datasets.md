How many images do we need? Well, previous research used around 1,000 to 5,000 images with 80% results, general object detection uses 300k images but we should aim to have 10k to 30k images total. We classification would make this faster 

1. [TACO](http://tacodataset.org/)
   - 1500 images
   - COCO format
 2. [TrashNet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet)
    - 2527 images
