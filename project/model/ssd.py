"""
Here are the changes I made:

Removed the global keyword as it's not needed in this code.
Simplified the code that checks if the input images is a list.
Simplified the code that loads the model, image transform, labels, and conversion dictionary.
Simplified the code that gets the top 10 values in the output array.
Simplified the code that calculates the trash class probabilities.
Converted the trash class probabilities to a list before adding it to the result dictionary.
Removed the unnecessary line that converts outputs to a NumPy array twice.
