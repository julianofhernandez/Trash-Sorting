'''
Here are the main changes made in this code:

Replaced 'multiprocessing.Pool' with 'concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor' 
for improved performance and more flexibility.

Moved the code for reading files and constructing data and files dictionaries 
into a separate function send_file_to_server for improved readability and 
maintainability.

Replaced the use of global variables with function parameters and arguments 
for improved encapsulation and reusability.

Changed the URL construction to use http instead of https and added a 
missing leading slash to the endpoint.

Added error checking with response.raise_for_status() to ensure that 
requests to the server are successful.

Improved the print statement to include the status code of the server's 
response.

These changes should help make the code more reliable, maintainable, 
and scalable, while retaining its core functionality of sending image 
files with annotations to a server.
